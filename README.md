A sidebar is the combination of several navigation links aligned vertically at the left or right side of the web page. Sidebar helps users to get into the different webpage through the help of navigation links and they have open and close features.

Letâ€™s have a look at the given image of our sidebar menu that I have given on the webpage. On the right side, we can see the light mode features of the sidebar and on the left side, we can see the dark mode of the sidebar. Actually, those image which has big width are the opened form of the sidebar, and those images that have small width that is the closed form of the sidebar.
